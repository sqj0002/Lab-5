Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study.
- I am organized with my documents and code, however I need to do a better job of documenting the code I use and have used in the past. I think it would be beneficial to me to have a space where I can keep all of my previous code used, so that I can reuse code or use a variation for different projects. A major way non-reproducible research affects computational biology and bioinformatics is the fact that statistically non-significant results and seemingly unoriginal replications are rarely published. Non-reproducible research claim a significant result, but the findings cannot be reproduced. I think the reproducibility crisis will definitely affect my career goals and future research in any STEM related field. With anyone wanting to pursue a career in STEM research, reproducibility is extremely important. If the results of many scientific studies cannot be reproduced, then it is likely to be seen as wrong.
